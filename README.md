## Overview

This project is designed to help you automate the process of extracting data from a PDF report, preprocessing the data, and training a machine learning model. The project is divided into three main scripts:
1. `extract_text.py`: Extracts text from a PDF file.
2. `preprocess_data.py`: Preprocesses the extracted text and converts it into a structured format.
3. `train_model.py`: Trains a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
